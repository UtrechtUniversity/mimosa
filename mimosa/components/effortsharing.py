    Equal mitigation costs implies that the regional mitigation costs in every year (in terms of
    percentage of GDP) should be the same for every region:

    value accross all the regions[^1].

    [^1]: Note that for numerical stability, the constraint is not implemented as an equality constraint,
        but as an "almost-equality" constraint (called soft-equality constraint). This means that it is enough
        if the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) are very close to each other (less than 0.5%):

        $$

    In this effort-sharing regime, the damages are also taken into account when equalising the costs among regions:

    $$
    \\frac{\\text{mitig. costs}_{t,r}}{\\text{GDP}_{\\text{gross},t,r}} + \\text{damages}_{t,r}\\ (+ \\text{rel. financial transf.}_{t,r}) = \\text{common level}_t,

    For feasibility reasons, this constraint is only enforced until 2100.

    Compared to the equal mitigation cost regime, this regime might be infeasible, especially for regions with very high damages, unless:

    * (a) the mitigation costs can be negative (for regions with very high damages). This can be achieved with the
        parameter [`rel_mitigation_costs_min_level`](../parameters.md#economics.MAC.rel_mitigation_costs_min_level).

    * or (b) if financial transfers are allowed between regions, that go beyond emission trading. See [Financial transfers](financialtransfers.md).

    The per capita convergence regime allocates equal per capita emission rights to each region, starting
    from a given year (called the convergence year). The convergence year can be set with the parameter
    [`percapconv_year`](../parameters.md#effort sharing.percapconv_year) and is
    set to 2050 by default. Before this convergence year, the allowances are interpolated
    between grandfathering (current emission distribution) in 2020 and equal per capita emission rights in the convergence year.


    Therefore, two functions are needed. First, the allowances for equal per capita emissions (EPC):

    $$
    \\text{allowances}_{\\text{EPC}, t, r} = \\frac{\\text{population}_{t,r}}{\\sum_{s} \\text{population}_{t,s}} \\cdot \\text{global emissions}_{t},
    $$

    and second the allowances for grandfathering (GF):

    $$
    \\text{allowances}_{\\text{GF}, t, r} = \\frac{\\text{baseline emissions}_{0,r}}{\\sum_{s} \\text{baseline emissions}_{0,s}} \\cdot \\text{global emissions}_{t},
    $$

    :::mimosa.components.effortsharing.percapconv_share_rule

    Finally, the allowances per region are added as constraint on the regional emissions. Since this regime needs
    [emission trading](emissiontrading.md) to avoid infeasibility, the regional emissions can be expressed as the baseline emissions
    minus the reductions that this region needs to pay for (this is not necessarily equal to the regional emissions
    in physical terms, as the region can buy or sell allowances from other regions):

    $$
    \\text{allowances}_{t,r} = \\text{baseline emissions}_{t,r} - \\text{paid for emission reductions}_{t,r}
    $$
