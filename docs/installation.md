# Installing MIMOSA

MIMOSA is written in Python, and can be installed using `pip`:
```bash
pip install mimosa
```

If you don't have Python installed yet, we highly recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) to install python. 

## Installing the optimisation engine IPOPT

Since MIMOSA is an optimisation model, an optimisation engine needs to be specified. We use the open-source optimisation engine IPOPT, which can be installed as a `conda` package.

=== "On Windows"

    ```
    conda install -c conda-forge ipopt>=3.14.17
    ```

=== "On MacOS"

    ```
    conda install -c idaes-pse -c conda-forge idaes-pse

    conda install -c conda-forge ipopt
    ```

=== "On Linux"

    ```
    conda install -c conda-forge ipopt
    ```


Once IPOPT is installed, you can now solve your MIMOSA runs (see [Running MIMOSA](run.md)):
```python
from mimosa import MIMOSA, load_params

params = load_params()

model1 = MIMOSA(params)
model1.solve()
model1.save("run1")
```


??? info "Fixing the error `IPOPT not found` on Windows"

    Sometimes, installing IPOPT with conda fails on Windows. To fix it, go to <https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt/releases> and download the latest win64-version. Unzip the files. A subfolder `bin` should contain the file `ipopt.exe`. The next step is to add this folder to your PATH environment:
    Windows > Edit the system environment variables > Environment variables... > Select "Path" and click Edit... > Click New and browse to the folder you just unzipped. Make sure to select the `bin` subfolder as this folder contains the file `ipopt.exe`.

    1. Once you've downloaded the zip file of the latest win64-version on the coin website (currently `Ipopt-3.14.15-win64-msvs2019-md.zip`),
    unzip this file to folder of your choice. In the unzipped folder, there should be a `bin` folder.
    2. The next step is to tell Windows to look for IPOPT in this `bin` directory. This is achieved by adding the relevant folder to the *environment path* of Windows. Click on Start (or press the ++win++ key), type `environment` and press ++enter++. This should open the dialog `Edit the system environment variables`.
    3. Click on `Environment variables`, select `Path` and click edit.<br><br>![](assets/fig/install01.png)<br><br>
    4. Here, you can add the folder with the IPOPT bin folder. Click on New and add the folder you unzipped IPOPT in, making sure to select the sub-folder `bin`:<br><br>![](assets/fig/install02.png)<br><br>
    5. You can test if everything works by opening an Anaconda Prompt and typing `ipopt`. It should show something like this:<br><br>![](assets/fig/install03.png)<br><br>


??? info "Running MIMOSA without local computations"

    If you don't want to install IPOPT on your computer, you can also use the NEOS server (<https://neos-server.org>) to run MIMOSA remotely. This way,
    the installation of IPOPT is not required. This can be useful if you don't want to use your own computer to do the runs. However, this is typically much slower than installing IPOPT locally.

    First, on the NEOS website, sign up for a free account. You can then run MIMOSA with NEOS enabled by simply providing it with the email address you used to sign up for NEOS:

    ```python
    from mimosa import MIMOSA, load_params

    params = load_params()

    model1 = MIMOSA(params)
    # Change "your.email@email.com" to your the email address you used to sign up for NEOS
    model1.solve(use_neos=True, neos_email="your.email@email.com") 
    model1.save("run1")
    ```

    Depending on the MIMOSA parameters chosen and on how busy the NEOS server is, running the model might take a while (typically a couple of minutes).
